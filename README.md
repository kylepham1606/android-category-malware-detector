# android-category-malware-detector

EECS 448 Final Project with Tyler Thielding migrated from GitLab. 

The project analyzes permission usage of Android applications based on their categories on the Google Play store. Using information about permissions and categories, a malware detector using a statistical scoring method is developed, which gives promising results without having to further analyze other components in these applications.
