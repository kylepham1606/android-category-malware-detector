# android-category-malware-detector

EECS 448 Final Project with Tyler Thielding migrated from GitLab. 

The project analyzes permission usage of Android applications based on their categories on the Google Play store. Using information about permissions and categories, a malware detector using a statistical scoring method is developed, which gives promising results without having to further analyze other components in these applications.

## For End-User with Pre-Built Data Set:

1. Copy `eecs448_permissions_data.malware_and_categorized_google_play_apps.json` to user root directory (e.g.,
   `C:\Users\tyler`).
   
2. Do an editable install of this package using Python 2 with `pip install -e .` at the root of the repository.

3. Find Android app datasets and extract them

4. Using a command prompt terminal one directory above the extracted data set, run the following command: `py -2 -m
   android_permission_analysis <directory_name> <category_name>`
